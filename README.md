# A guide for Unit Testing in Golang

This is a work in progress. The goal of this repository is to teach unit testing to anyone interested in learning it. Over the last several years I have worked at many tech companies and one thing I've noticed everyone struggling with is Unit Testing. I'm a firm believer in Test Driven Development (more specifically Behavior Driven Development). In this series I plan on proving that testable code is good code and that testing should be simple.

What will be covered?

- Interfaces
- Mocks/Dependency Injection
- BDD/Ginkgo
- Identifying bad code
- Testing when imported functions are involved
